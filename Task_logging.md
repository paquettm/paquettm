# Task Log

A task log is a list of the things you worked on in a day. You must record, each day
- the tasks you worked on
- the completion status of these tasks: for each task, write if you completed it, if it is ongoing, if you are awaiting feedback, if information is missing and which information
- with whom you worked on these tasks, when and where
- a brief indication of how you worked on this task

example:
| Date  | Description  | Status  |
|---|---|---|
| June 10, 2023 | Google SSO for the MockTube Web Application, at the office with Josh before lunch. Implementation with the JS library. | Complete  |
| June 10, 2023 | Facebook integration for MockTube video promotion. At the office, alone, after lunch.  | Missing information about the request format: must ask Josh. |

Keep your daily task log beside you while you work and complete it at least once at the end of the day. Many companies require employees to log their activities because of
1. research and development requirements,
2. client billing purposes,
3. etc.

Get used to the exercise, because logging your time is a first step to learning how to harness and maximise your time.

Moreover, this documentation exercise will enable you to track your time at work, to justify your use of time, request a higher salary, or provide supporting documentation when billing consultation clients.

## Deadline

After each 100 hours of internship, you must deliver one task log covering this reporting period.

## Requirements

Write your task log in tabular (table) format with the following information fields, from left to right: Date, Description, Status. Fill in the details as indicated above. Keep your task logging sheet next to your workstation and make a habit of logging tasks each time you change what you do. At the end of each day, verify that you have recorded the list of the things you worked on and make corrections where needed.
