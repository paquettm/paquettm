# Job Search Strategies

Job search strategies in the tech industry have evolved significantly, and it's crucial to adopt a multi-faceted approach to land your ideal role.

Before we develop the general strategy, let's quickly go through any known specific strategies.

## Video Game Industry

Any studio will be looking for some code sample(s) and maybe even a video demo of a project; you must have a video game project on GitHub available to share anytime.
Students work to figure out their own projects, so writing a game development doc, even high level, shows a comprehension and ability beyond what can be communicated verbally; include a GDD in your video game project repository.

## Networking at Meetups

One of the most powerful job search strategies is networking, particularly at tech meetups and conferences.
These events provide invaluable opportunities to connect with peers and potential employers in your field. By attending these gatherings, you can:

- Build relationships with industry professionals
- Learn about unadvertised job openings
- Gain insights into company cultures and work environments
- Showcase your expertise and passion for technology

Remember, many tech roles are filled through referrals, so expanding your network can significantly increase your chances of landing a desirable position.

## Knowing What You Want

Before diving into your job search, it's crucial to define your expectations and career objectives. This involves:

- Determining your preferred work arrangement (full-time, part-time, or freelance)
- Deciding on your ideal work environment (office-based or remote)
- Identifying the type of company you'd like to work for (corporation, startup, or non-profit)
- Specifying the industry or technologies you're most interested in

By clearly defining your goals, you can focus your efforts on opportunities that align with your aspirations, making your job search more efficient and effective.

## Searching in Multiple Places

To maximize your chances of finding the right role, it's essential to cast a wide net and search across various platforms. Consider the following strategies:

- Leverage job portals like LinkedIn, Indeed and Glassdoor
- Utilize niche job search platforms specific to the tech industry
- Set up job alerts on multiple platforms to stay informed about new openings
- Directly contact companies you're interested in, bypassing job boards
- Use social media platforms beyond LinkedIn, such as Twitter and Facebook, to discover opportunities

Remember to use different job title variations in your searches, as recruiters may use various terms to describe similar roles.

## Accepting Roles with Growth Potential

While it's important to have a clear vision of your ideal role, it's also wise to consider positions that offer growth potential.
Sometimes, the perfect job may not be immediately available, but you can find opportunities that can evolve into your desired role.
When evaluating potential positions, consider:
