# Hi :smiley: My name is Michel Paquette :smiley:

I am a full-stack developer, engineer, and computer science teacher.

## Current Activities

I organise and supervise Computer Science student internships.

- [Resume Writing](Resume_Writing.md)
- [Internship Activity Logging](Internship_logging.md)

Winter of 2024, I was teaching eCommerce 
- See the [PHP Guide repo](https://github.com/paquettm/PHP_Guide)
- See the [H24 Section 1 current codebase](https://github.com/paquettm/eComH24S1) 

See my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MichelPaquette) where you will find an older full course playlist:
- [PHP MVC Web application development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XRK0U4WKRQ&list=PLk4WFMCLz7Cy-deb3GefNca_SrDWXz7gj)



## Fall 2023: Internet of Things: Introduction to Python Programming

Fun class to teach and hopefully equally fun to follow ([see the repo](https://github.com/paquettm/420-302-VA_A23)).

## Past Teaching: Python and development of PHP MVC Web applications

See my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MichelPaquette) where you will find full course playlists:
- [PHP MVC Web application development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XRK0U4WKRQ&list=PLk4WFMCLz7Cy-deb3GefNca_SrDWXz7gj)
- [Introductory Python Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q53t9rO1ISI&list=PLk4WFMCLz7CwGoYjGX9ov_EISs445ExVy)

these series could use some updates, but the world is so big and there is so little time!
