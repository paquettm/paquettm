# Hi :wave: My name is Michel Paquette :smiley:

I am a full-stack developer, engineer, and computer science teacher.

I like to program with and teach Python. Do you know about the [free OpenStax Python programming online book](https://openstax.org/books/introduction-python-programming/pages/1-introduction)?

OpenStax has [a few computer science free online resources](https://openstax.org/subjects/computer-science)
