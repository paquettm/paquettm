# Hi :smiley: My name is Michel Paquette :smiley:

I am a full-stack developer and engineer.

## Current Activities

As a teacher, I am keeping students learning by keeping them honest.

I am teaching Internet of Things: Introduction to Python Programming ([see the repo](https://github.com/paquettm/420-302-VA_A23)).

I also organise and supervise Computer Science student internships.

## Past Teaching: Python and development of PHP MVC Web applications

See my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MichelPaquette) where you will find full course playlists:
- [PHP MVC Web application development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XRK0U4WKRQ&list=PLk4WFMCLz7Cy-deb3GefNca_SrDWXz7gj)
- [Introductory Python Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q53t9rO1ISI&list=PLk4WFMCLz7CwGoYjGX9ov_EISs445ExVy)

these series could use some updates, but the world is so big and there is so little time!
