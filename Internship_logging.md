# Task Log

A task log is a list of the things you worked on in a day. You must record, each day
- the tasks you worked on
- the completion status of these tasks: for each task, write if you completed it, if it is ongoing, if you are awaiting feedback, if information is missing and which information
- with whom you worked on these tasks, when and where
- a brief indication of how you worked on this task

example:
| Date  | Description  | Status  |
|---|---|---|
| June 10, 2023 | Google SSO for the MockTube Web Application, at the office with Josh before lunch. Implementation with the JS library. | Complete  |
| June 10, 2023 | Facebook integration for MockTube video promotion. At the office, alone, after lunch.  | Missing information about the request format: must ask Josh. |

Keep your daily task log beside you while you work and complete it at least once at the end of the day. Many companies require employees to log their activities because of
1. research and development requirements,
2. client billing purposes,
3. etc.

Get used to the exercise, because logging your time is a first step to learning how to harness and maximise your time.

Moreover, this documentation exercise will enable you to track your time at work, to justify your use of time, request a higher salary, or provide supporting documentation when billing consultation clients.

## Deadline

After each 100 hours of internship, you must deliver one task log covering this reporting period.

## Requirements

Write your task log in tabular (table) format with the following information fields, from left to right: Date, Description, Status. Fill in the details as indicated above. Keep your task logging sheet next to your workstation and make a habit of logging tasks each time you change what you do. At the end of each day, verify that you have recorded the list of the things you worked on and make corrections where needed.

# Reflection log

The purpose of a reflection log is to support your career and personal development. In the reflection log, you should write
1. What you did,
2. how you did it, 
3. why you did it, 
4. who with, 
5. when, 
6. what worked, 
7. what did not work, 
8. what knowledge were you using,
9. what knowledge is missing, and 
10. what you learned.

Hopefully, those events and this reflection will provide insight and indications of required/desirable future development (the desired outcome).
## Example Entry

A sample entry in a reflection log could be as follows:

2023-05-29, at the Office, in an all-day pair programming session with Johnny Appleseed, we implemented Google Single Sign On for our MockTube Web application. We both used our knowledge of JavaScript OOP to integrate the Google JavaScript library into our application.  During the session, I learned how to write functions with default parameters. My knowledge of callback structure in JS needs work. Moreover, I will have to get used to pair programming as it will be my responsibility to onboard new hires a year from now.

## Your Deliverable

A list of daily entries could be somewhat interesting, but would not bring intense insight into the process. Therefore, you must go through your daily entries and synthesise groups of entries related to the same project and find the overarching/recurring themes and items. From this, you should be able to prioritise your future learning/development items. A sample paragraph may be as follows:

2023-05-28 to 2023-06-02, at the Office, I spent most of my time working on the MockTube Web application, supervised by team lead Johnny Appleseed. For this application, I spent most of my time implementing features using front-end JavaScript and tying it in with the backend to we implemented Google Single Sign On and other authentication options. I learned a lot of native JavaScript and moving forward must increase my knowledge of callback structure in JS. 

I faced one major technical challenge when left alone: I could not understand how the JWT would get to be secure if it was called in the front end. I soon learned that the authentication process has front-end and back-end phases that enable security.

I found that the process of pair programming was worth the effort to make sure that team members get to maximise their learning from one-another. Moreover, I will have to get comfortavble with this process I will use this to help onboard new hires as early as December.

## Deadline

After each 100 hours of internship, you must deliver one reflection log covering this reporting period.

## General guidelines

- Don't assume the reader remembers your previous logs. Instead, provide context, such as the name, description, and purpose of the project(s) on which you have been working.
- Write less. Don't go into details about what you did with each class/program/control, etc. Keep your report at a high level.
- But write more. What challenges did you face technically? What were the learning opportunities?
- Explain carefully. Don't expect the reader to know acronyms and project names.
- Write short sentences and brief paragraphs. If you worked on four projects, give a paragraph to each one. In each paragraph, stay on topic. Please be concise but clear.

Hint: Keep a daily task log beside you while you work. Many companies require employees to log their activities because of research and development requirements. Use this log as a reference for your periodic summary of Internship work as well as for your Final Report. But please do not just copy abbreviated notes from your log into a report. Rather you should use the notes to create a clear and grammatically correct summary of the work. 

## Requirements

Your reflection logs, submitted as pdf files, must contain the following three sections: 

### Section 1 - COMPACT HEADER 

Date 
Student Name and ID 
Company Name 
Faculty Supervisor Name(s) 
Time period covered (don't forget to update this each time!) 

### Section 2 - TECHNICAL INFORMATION 

- Remind the reader of what project you are working on, and the degree of completion (how far you are from finishing it). 
- Then, in one page (maximum 2 pages if necessary) describe the nature, content, and progress of your work during the last reporting period. The tone and style of this section should be neutral and professional. 
- Describe what you did, how you did it, why you did it, what worked, what did not work, what knowledge you were using, and **what you learned**.
- **Provide insight of wanted future development**: tell us about what you need to learn to further advance.
- You should write in full sentences and paragraphs, but you may use bulleted lists where appropriate.

### Section 3 - PERSONAL INFORMATION

This section is reserved for your opinions, feelings, and concerns. We are very interested in your feedback and how you are getting along. This section is the place to tell us, for example, whether you are comfortable with the Internship workplace, whether you are overwhelmed or bored with the work, if your Industry supervisor is available when needed to answer your questions, and so on. 

You are not negatively assessed for information provided in section 3. We are asking you to be honest about your workplace internship. If there are any problems, please report them in one of your Periodic Reports or contact your faculty supervisors. 

Do not mix personal comments with the technical information. Write this section on a different page, after the TECHNICAL INFORMATION section of your report.
