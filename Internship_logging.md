# Internship Activity Logging

Internships are privileged experiences when the student can finally explore a real work environment and live the experiences of the workplace.
These experiences can be overwhelming and it is easy to lose sight of the importance of some experiences that are lived in this context.

A few tools can be used by the student wanting to fully profit from their internship experience: [Task logging](Task_logging.md) and [Reflection logging](Reflection_logging.md).
Truthfully, these tools are not only for students going through their internship, but for anyone going through any experience and wanting to gain more insight and growth.

One goal of [Task logging](Task_logging.md) is to take notes of what is mgoing on in order not to forget.
These notes can be used for many purposes, such as: self-evaluating performance in view of payraise negotiations, job changes, etc.
One purpose of the task log is to be able to take a step back from one's daily activities and examine them globally.
With such a point of view, it becomes possible to reflect on one's experiences and gain insight into our ways of acting and being.

One goal of [Reflection logging](Reflection_logging.md) is to force yourself to see your experiences more globally and the best way forward to growth.
By looking at your daily activities as a big picture, we can see trends and overarching themes, making it possible to see what generally works well, or not, what generally is fun, or not, etc.
Through sufficient practice at the exercise of self-reflection, someone will be able to gain insight in who they are, what they are doing, what they want, and how to move forward, for instance.
The goal of this exercise is to find a way forward to growth of the self, of competence, etc.

## Internship Reporting Requirements for Vanier College Computer Science Programs

Computer Science program internships at Vanier College have a 300-hour duration, i.e., students work for at least 300 hours while on internship.
For example, Computer Science technology students have internships 3 days per week, 7 work hours per day, for 15 weeks.
Software Development students have internships over the course of 9 to 12 weeks, with specific dates and durations for each cohort, and over that duration, 300 hours will be spent working at the host company.

An important part of th internship experience is the internship search.
for this purpose, an [Internship Preparation Report](Internship_Preparation_Report.md) is required at the first or second week of the internship.

Then, to ensure proper self-reflection during the internship, each 100-hour period should be reported through a [task log](Task_logging.md) and matching [reflection log](Reflection_logging.md).
In other words, over the duration of the internship, there will be 3 task and matching reflection logs.

Finally, at most 3 days after the end of the internship, a [Final written report](Final_Written_Report.md) is required.
