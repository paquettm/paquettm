# Task Log

A task log is a list of the things you worked on in a day. You must record, each day
- the tasks you worked on
- the completion status of these tasks: for each task, did you complete it or is it ongoing?

Keep your daily task log beside you while you work and complete it at least once at the end of the day. Many companies require employees to log their activities because of research and development requirements.

The goal of this documentation exercise is to enable you to track your time at work, to justify your use of time, request a higher salary, or provide supporting documentation when billing a client.

## Deadline

After each 100 hours of internship, you must deliver one reflection log covering this reporting period.

## Requirements

Write your task log in tabular (table) format with the following information fields, from left to right: date, tasks, status of each task ('started', 'ongoing', or 'complete').

At least at the end of each day, record a list of the things you worked on.

# Reflection log

The purpose of a reflection log is to support your career and personal development. In the reflection log, you must write:
1) What you did, how you did it, why you did it, what worked, what did not work, what knowledge were you using, and what did you learn?
Hopefully, those events and this reflection will provide an indication of wanted future development. This is the desired outcome.

## Deadline

After each 100 hours of internship, you must deliver one reflection log covering this reporting period.

## General guidelines

- Don't assume the reader remembers your previous logs. Instead, provide context, such as the name, description, and purpose of the project(s) on which you have been working.
- Write less. Don't go into details about what you did with each class/program/control, etc. Keep your report at a high level.
- But write more. What challenges did you face technically? What were the learning opportunities?
- Explain carefully. Don't expect the reader to know acronyms and project names.
- Write short sentences and brief paragraphs. If you worked on four projects, give a paragraph to each one. In each paragraph, stay on topic. Please be concise but clear.

Hint: Keep a daily task log beside you while you work. Many companies require employees to log their activities because of research and development requirements. Use this log as a reference for your periodic summary of Internship work as well as for your Final Report. But please do not just copy abbreviated notes from your log into a report. Rather you should use the notes to create a clear and grammatically correct summary of the work. 

## Requirements

Your reflection logs, submitted as pdf files, must contain the following three sections: 

### Section 1 - COMPACT HEADER 

Date 
Student Name and ID 
Company Name 
Faculty Supervisor Name(s) 
Time period covered (don't forget to update this each time!) 

### Section 2 - TECHNICAL INFORMATION 

- Remind the reader of what project you are working on, and the degree of completion (how far you are from finishing it). 
- Then, in one page (maximum 2 pages if necessary) describe the nature, content, and progress of your work during the last reporting period. The tone and style of this section should be neutral and professional. 
- Describe what you did, how you did it, why you did it, what worked, what did not work, what knowledge you were using, and what you learned.
- Provide insight of wanted future development.
- You should write in full sentences and paragraphs, but you may use bulleted lists where appropriate.

### Section 3 - PERSONAL INFORMATION

This section is reserved for your opinions, feelings, and concerns. We are very interested in your feedback and how you are getting along. This section is the place to tell us, for example, whether you are comfortable with the Internship workplace, whether you are overwhelmed or bored with the work, if your Industry supervisor is available when needed to answer your questions, and so on. 

You are not negatively assessed for information provided in section 3. We are asking you to be honest about your workplace internship. If there are any problems, please report them in one of your Periodic Reports or contact your faculty supervisors. 

Do not mix personal comments with the technical information. Write this section on a different page, after the TECHNICAL INFORMATION section of your report.
