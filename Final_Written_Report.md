Guidelines for Final Report

Your written language should be neutral and professional.
At the beginning of the document, write a half-page abstract that summarizes your report.
Note that your Final Report is an individual task. Even if your internship work was done in a team, you must write your own report, with no collaboration or help from anyone else.
Use spell-check and grammar-check when proof-reading your report.
Use a simple clear typed format for your report.
Do not include information which should not be communicated according to any Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) that you may have signed.
Provide your report to your Industry supervisor before handing it in to make sure that no confidential information is included.
