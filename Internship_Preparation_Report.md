# Internship Preparation Report

After one (1) week in your internship, provide a brief description of the process of obtaining an internship, on the business domains of the different companies for which you interviewed, and on the business environment of the specific company or department you are working for. 

The document should be between 1 and 2 pages in length, single space, 11-point font.

Summarize the various interviews you had, commenting on how well you were prepared for the interview.
For each of the companies you interviewed, describe the industry as a whole (the business domain) commenting on the extent to which information technology is used within that industry.
For the company where you are doing your internship summarize the company itself (the business environment), including its competitors, its internal organizational structure, and its IT implementation.
